## What is Calyx?

Calyx is a simple and powerful software library for crafting generative writing machines. It provides tools for producing randomized sequences of text using a syntax inspired by generative grammars.

Its primary affordances are for creating bots and weird combinatorial prose and poetry but you can use it to generate anything that has a textual or tree-based representation, including SVG graphics, narrative graphs and midi notes.

## Supported Runtimes

- Ruby
- JavaScript
- More... (let us know)



## Why grammars?

There are many useful and interesting methods for generative writing. The grammar-based approach is popular, widely studied and practiced, and easy to get started with.

Grammars offer direct authorial control over the fragments that combine to produce an output text. This involves more effort and structure than other more random approaches, but leads to carefully crafted and expressive results which still have a capacity to surprise, delight, and confound—as any good text generation method should.

## Getting Started

Get started with a [simple tutorial](/introduction/tutorial/) or learn more about the [underlying concepts](/introduction/concepts/). If you’re new to Ruby and generative art in general, the [documentation for beginners](/introduction/beginners/) is a good place to start.

Use the [guides](/docs/guides/) to learn how to use the various features and capabilities of the library. For more direct and structured information, the [reference](/docs/reference/) contains a full breakdown of everything that Calyx supports.
