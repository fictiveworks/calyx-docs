## Faker

[Faker](https://github.com/stympy/faker) is a popular library for generating fake names and associated sample data like internet addresses, company names and locations.

This example demonstrates how to use Calyx to reproduce the same functionality using custom lists defined in a YAML configuration file.

```
ruby examples/faker.rb
```
